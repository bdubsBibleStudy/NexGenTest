## Questions for Thought
- <mark style="background: #3EFF00E0;">Who were Solomon's Parents?</mark> David and Bathsheba
- <mark style="background: #3EFF00E0;">What was Solomon's nickname given to him by Nathan?</mark> Jedidiah
	- Why did Nathan call him Jedidiah? The name Jedidiah means "Beloved of the Lord" (2 Samuel 12:24-25)
- <mark style="background: #3EFF00E0;">What was his occupation?</mark> King!
- <mark style="background: #3EFF00E0;">Where did Solomon's wisdom come from?</mark> The Lord. God gave him "a wise and understanding heart" (1 Kings 3:12)
- <mark style="background: #3EFF00E0;">What brought about the granting of wisdom to him?</mark> A Prayer to the Lord in the night
- <mark style="background: #3EFF00E0;">What was Solomon's conclusion to the meaning and importance of life?</mark> (Hint: read the book of Ecclesiastes) Vanity, enjoying the blessings of God when given. And trusting Him when the blessings aren't there
- <mark style="background: #3EFF00E0;">Who are some of the best people to get advice from?</mark> Those with wisdom and those with experience...
	- the book of Ecclesiastes warns us about the old king who refuses to listen to counsel. 
- <mark style="background: #3EFF00E0;">What can we learn from Solomon's life?</mark> Besides just what he wrote in Proverbs and Ecclesiastes...
	- <mark style="background: #FBFF00E0;">One piece that stands out to me as we read thru his life - the small compromises that add up.</mark> Well it'll be ok if I just compromise here. This can't hurt too badly. Keep in mind this is the wisest natural man to live. <mark style="background: #00FFD3E0;">Even with all of the knowledge, his failure to apply that knowledge in everyday situations led to a compromised king and tarnished record</mark> (see <mark style="background: #E100FFBA;">Ecclesiastes 10:1</mark>).

1. ## A wish granted
	1. given after he was focused on sacrifice and worshiping God
		1. <mark style="background: #E100FFBA;">1 Kings 3:6-13</mark> - he asked for wisdom and discernment over wealth or other worldly pursuits
		2. <mark style="background: #FBFF00E0;">James 1:5</mark> <mark style="background: #FBFF00E0;">- we can have wisdom too if we ask!</mark> This is a theme throughout the book of Proverbs as well
	2. God loved him, but Solomon was also trying to do right. <mark style="background: #3EFF00E0;">Was he perfect?</mark> Nope!
		1. Let's look at <mark style="background: #E100FFBA;">1 Kings 3:3</mark> - <mark style="background: #FBFF00E0;">he was sacrificing in the high places that the Canaanites would worship in.</mark> This was a pagan practice and the worship of God was intended to be in a holy place, different from the world.
		2. <mark style="background: #00FFD3E0;">What's interesting though is the reasoning</mark>...in <mark style="background: #E100FFBA;">vs 2</mark>, the writer says that there was no house of the Lord in that time so the people resorted to sacrifices in the Canaanite high places.
		3. This was warned against in <mark style="background: #E100FFBA;">Deuteronomy</mark> <mark style="background: #E100FFBA;">12:1-9</mark> - because they weren't in their forever home yet.
2. ## The folly of marrying outside your faith
	1. he was close with the enemy -<mark style="background: #E100FFBA;"> 1 Kings 3:1</mark>
	2. <mark style="background: #E100FFBA;">Deuteronomy 7:2-5</mark> - they were forbidden from marrying the pagans in the land. <mark style="background: #3EFF00E0;">Why</mark>?? To protect against being led astray.
	3. <mark style="background: #00FFD3E0;">Let's apply this to our lives now today</mark>...<mark style="background: #3EFF00E0;">is it ok to date an unbeliever? </mark>
		1. the Bible says marrying isn't good, but can I at least date them??
	4. Wait a minute...Solomon was blessed, even though he wasn't doing everything just right. <mark style="background: #FBFF00E0;">So how far can we go and what all can we get away with while still getting God's blessings??</mark> 
		1. Solomon talks about this, in even more extreme terms in <mark style="background: #E100FFBA;">Ecclesiastes 8:14</mark>. Let's put this into today's terms...Life isn't always fair! <mark style="background: #3EFF00E0;">But what's our hope as Christians?</mark> Solomon expounds on this in <mark style="background: #E100FFBA;">8:12-13.</mark> 
		2. David shares about the end of man in <mark style="background: #E100FFBA;">Psalms 37</mark>:7, 9-13, 16-20. <mark style="background: #00FFD3E0;">We all die, but the righteous and the wicked will both have a different end. </mark>
			1. <mark style="background: #FBFF00E0;">Ok, we all know I like to bring this up from time to time. </mark>We all know it, but I don't want to take for granted our salvation. <mark style="background: #3EFF00E0;">How are we known as righteous? </mark>Through Christ's blood and faith in Him that covers our sin in His righteousness!! (Romans 3:24-25)
4. ## Multiplication!
	1. Wives
	2. Gold & silver
	3. Horses & Chariots - some trust in horses (<mark style="background: #E100FFBA;">Psalms 20:5-9</mark>)
